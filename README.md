## My Journey
I am going to use this page to document my journey into the information security world. As someone with no professional experience in this field, I have
a long journey of self learning ahead of me. I plan on tackling the CompTIA Network+ certification first, in order to build a solid networking foundation. In addition, I have purchased a membership to TryHackMe and several courses from TheCyberMentor. I hope to use these courses to build experience and familiarity in cybersecurity. Ultimately I hope to secure a position in this field.
