## Network Components

**Client**

A device used by an end-user to access the network. This could be a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, etc.

**Server**

A device that provides resources to the reest of the network. Servers can provide different functions such as email servers, file servers, web servers etc.

**Hub**

A hub is an older piece of technology that is used to connect devices together. A hub could be used to connect two clients together for an example.
Hubs recieve information in one port and broadcast it out of all other ports.

**Wireless Access Point (WAP)**

A WAP is a device that allows wireless clients to connect to a wired network. This is essentially a wireless hub.

**Switch**

A "smart" hub. Switches are much more capable than hubs. They can learn which devices are connected to which ports and make smart forwarding
decisions.

**Router**

A router connects two different networks together. It can intelligently forward traffic to and from netowkrs based on logical adddresses.

**Media**

Media connects devices to each other or ports on a switch or router. It can be copper cabling, fiber optic or radio frequency waves. Each media has its
own pro's and con's.

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**

A WAN connects two seperate networks together.

## Network Resources

**Client/Server Model**

The Client/Server model uses a dedicated server to provide acccess to files, scanners, printers and many other resources.

**Peer to Peer Model**

Peers share resourses (printers/files) directly with each other.

## Network Geography 

**Personal Area Network (PAN)**

Smallest type of wired or wireless network. Covers approximately 10ft or less.
Ex. Bluetooth, USB

**Local Area Network (LAN)**

Connects components with a limited distance (100 meters or less).
Ex. Small office, one floor of an office building

**Campus Area Network (CAN)**

Connects building centric LANs across a campus or office park.

**Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

Connects scattered locations across a city or metro area (Approx 25 miles).

**Wide Area Network**

Connects geographically disparate networks. Consists of leased lines and VPN's tunneled over the internet. The internet as most people know it, is a global WAN.
